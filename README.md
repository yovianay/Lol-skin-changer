Usage
Compile source or download a compiled version.
Use Lol-skin-changer.exe or inject the built DLL into the game yourself.
Administrator privilege may be needed if the injector failed to inject the DLL.
League client can crash if R3nzSkin is injected before being in the game.
A workaround is to not inject until you are in the game (you will need to be fast to not disrupt the game).
Press Insert to bring up the menu.
Select the skin for you, your teammates, enemies, and wards.
Further optimizations
If your CPU supports AVX / AVX2 / AVX-512 instruction set, you can enable it in project settings. This should result in more performant code, optimized for your CPU. Currently SSE2 instructions are selected in project settings.
